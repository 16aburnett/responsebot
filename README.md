# ResponseBot 

The ResponseBot program takes English input from a user and returns a response based on that input. 

Currently, the program is in the development stage and there is no working version (yet!).

# Install

Download the repository. 

Install virtualenv with whatever python command you have for python 3.x 
```
$ python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
```
Create a virtual environment
```
$ python3 -m env env/
```
Activate the environment to use the resources
```

Then you need to download the dependancies. The requirements.txt file in the repo contains all the dependancies for this project. Once you install it, then you won't need to install it again 
```

```
While the env is activated, type the below command to run the program:
